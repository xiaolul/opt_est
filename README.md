*The scripts haven't been (completely) cleaned yet.*

## Preliminaries
- All the estimations are based on contributing runs only.
- TREC relevance judgmeents are used.
- By default (Currently), they are in binary mode.
- scipy, numpy are required 

## Operations done by those scripts
1. Relevance fitting (fit_prob.py)
2. The two-level estimation framework (\*opt.py and hybrid_opt.py related scripts.)
3. There are two different configurations:
      1. Loss function:
        - Loss a: minimizing per-system estimation error (loss-a)
        - Loss b: minimizing per-document estimation error (loss-b)
      2. Combine function:
        - Weighted average (Comb1)
        - Weighted geometric average (Comb2)
  
## Scripts and Explaination (that have been cleaned now)
  1. fit_prob.py: model relevance as a function of retrieval rank.
     - By default, it is based on method in [1]
     - Left out run names can be provided and perform leave out experiments.
     - Open randomization can do a shuffle-and-average operation for the fitting process.

  2. The first step optimizers in [2]
      - rbp_opt.py: loss-a and Comb1 
      - rbp_optd.py: loss-b and Comb1
      - rbp_opt_geo.py: loss-a and Comb2
      - rbp_optd_geo.py: loss-b and Comb2
      
  3. hybrid_opt_rbp.py: the second level rank estimator in [2] 
  
  4. kendall_dist.py: modified Kendall's distance defined in [2]
  
  5. naive_estimator.py: using coefficient of covariance in [3]
  
   
  
  
## Input
 1. A set of contributing runs.
 2. The qrel file (which has the correct depth as specified)
 3. The rank-level estimations *must* run first as an input to the "*opt" estimators.
